Main steps:

• Understanding of the Dataset
• Loading and Sampling
• EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis
• Preprocessing + Splitting data into Training and Validation
Set
• Classification: Neural Network from scratch and Transfer
Learning
• Selection and Comparison of the Best Models
• Fitting on Test data and Best Model Choice

Main Results from scratch:

# How to run the code

Unless otherwise specified in the notebook section all codes can be runned in Google Colaboratory platform. All notebooks all already setted to import the necessary packages and also in this way you can easily use a GPU!
